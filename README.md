#  Laptop Market Trends Dashboard (Interactive Excel)

## Summary

An interactive Excel dashboard that explores laptop market trends across operating systems, CPU models, GPU companies, storage types, RAM sizes, and screen dimensions. The dashboard presents clean visuals with slicers and charts, making it easy to uncover insights about performance, pricing, and design preferences.

## Overview

This project analyzes a laptop dataset to understand how laptops vary by brand, hardware specifications, operating systems, and display features. The dashboard highlights which processors dominate, how storage is distributed across screen sizes, and which GPU companies lead in different categories. Interactive slicers allow users to filter by company, screen size, and other attributes for deeper exploration.

 ## Problem Statement

The laptop market is diverse, with thousands of models offering different specifications. It’s difficult to identify clear trends in raw data. Questions like Which CPU models are most common? Which screen sizes dominate? How does storage vary across laptops? are not easy to answer. This dashboard converts raw data into meaningful visuals that provide clear answers.
